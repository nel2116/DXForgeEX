description: Write and present the instruction text that has an Orca coordinator (/orchestration) carry out DXForgeEX issues. Use when the user says 「プロンプトを提示して」「〜のためのプロンプトを」「指示文を作って」, or when preparing to hand off work chosen with next-task. It only writes the text; it does not start workers or implement anything.

# Writing instructions for a coordinator

<!-- last-reviewed: 2026-11-05 -->

The user pastes the text written here into a new Claude session (the Orca coordinator). **Write and present it; never run it yourself.** The user once said 「勝手に進めないでプロンプトだけ提示して」. Do not start workers or begin implementing.

The template is `template.md` in this folder, distilled from earlier instructions (#10, #11/#107, #104, #116/#117).

## 1. Settle what must be decided

Ask only about what cannot be read from the user's request.

- **Target issues**: one or several. If several, one PR or parallel workers. Parallelize only when the edited files do not overlap.
- **Whether the user is present**: if absent, limit the work to what can be verified headless without the GUI. Decisions beyond the spec become "the coordinator decides in the direction of a smaller scope and reports why".
- **Whether a GUI check is needed**: changes to the editor screen, game run results or rendering need one. Then the coordinator stops before merging instead of running `-SetStatus`. The check is done by a separate worker the coordinator starts with `./.claude/skills/gui-check/start-gui-check.ps1 -Pr <N>`; the coordinator reads only the summary (#195). After the GUI check (or right away if none is needed), the coordinator runs `-SetStatus` through to the merge (human approval `merge-ok` is not required, #160). The worker runs `-Post` and fixes findings; only the coordinator runs `-SetStatus` (#195).

## 2. Research and fill in the premises

Most of the value is in the premises section (what the coordinator verified), so workers do not redo the research.

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json title,body,comments
git fetch -q origin && git log --oneline -15 origin/develop
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName
```

- Check the cause location written in the issue against the actual code (write it as `file:line`); it may have changed since the issue was written.
- For porting a Primal feature, write the Primal Day and where its implementation is.
- Mark anything unverified as (推定).
- Check that the edit scope does not overlap open PRs or leftover worktrees; if it does, write it under Ownership.

## 3. Fill in the template

- Fill in the `<...>` of `template.md`, and delete lines that do not apply (e.g. the GUI/no-GUI alternatives) as well as the last-reviewed line at the top.
- Write the completion conditions and Observable acceptance in a **verifiable form** (which command shows what, what happens before the fix). Never "it works".
- For a bug fix, include a condition that reproduces the failure before the fix.
- For hard work with several possible approaches, include a step where the approach is approved via ask before implementation, plus the "approach criteria". Leave them out for simple work.
- State what is out of scope, so the worker does not widen it.

## 4. Present it

- Show the whole text in one code block (` ```markdown `) so it can be copied as-is.
- Before the block, 2-4 lines in Japanese with the key points: what is done by how many workers, whether a GUI check is needed, whether auto-merge is scheduled, and any points you were unsure about.
- Then wait for the user's reply.
